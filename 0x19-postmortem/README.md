Postmortem: June 24, 2024 Outage

Issue Summary

o Duration: June 24, 2024, from 14:00 to 16:30 UTC

o Impact: Our primary web application was unavailable to 80% of users, resulting in an inability to access the main website and services. Users experienced timeouts and 500 Internal Server Error messages.

o Root Cause: A misconfigured load balancer that failed to distribute traffic correctly, leading to server overload and service disruption.

Timeline

o 14:00 UTC: Issue detected via monitoring alert indicating a high error rate.
o 14:05 UTC: Engineering team notified of the alert.
o 14:10 UTC: Initial investigation began, focusing on the application server logs.
o 14:30 UTC: Assumed root cause was a database connectivity issue; database team was involved.
o 15:00 UTC: Further investigation revealed no issues with the database; shifted focus to network infrastructure.
o 15:30 UTC: Discovered misconfiguration in the load balancer settings.
o 15:40 UTC: Escalated to the network engineering team for resolution.
o 16:00 UTC: Load balancer configuration corrected and system reboot initiated.
o 16:30 UTC: Services restored, monitoring confirmed normal operation.

Root Cause and Resolution

Root Cause

The issue was caused by an incorrect load balancer configuration. A recent update intended to optimize traffic distribution inadvertently left out several critical backend servers from the pool, causing excessive load on the remaining servers. This resulted in slow responses and ultimately server crashes due to resource exhaustion.

Resolution

The network engineering team reviewed and corrected the load balancer configuration, ensuring all backend servers were included in the traffic distribution pool. A system-wide reboot was performed to clear any residual issues. Post-fix, thorough testing confirmed that the load balancer was functioning correctly, and normal service resumed.

Corrective and Preventative Measures

Improvements/Fixes

o Load Balancer Configuration Review: Implement a rigorous review process for any load balancer configuration changes.
o Enhanced Monitoring: Add detailed monitoring and alerts for load balancer performance metrics.
o Documentation: Improve documentation on load balancer setup and maintenance procedures.
o Training: Conduct regular training sessions for the engineering team on network infrastructure management.

Task List

o Patch Load Balancer: Update and apply any recommended patches to the load balancer.
o Monitoring Setup: Add specific monitoring for load balancer health, including traffic distribution metrics and error rates.
o Documentation Update: Create a comprehensive guide on load balancer configuration changes and maintenance.
o Review Process: Establish a change review board to approve and audit any significant infrastructure changes.
o Training Program: Schedule bi-annual training sessions focused on network infrastructure and load balancer management.
