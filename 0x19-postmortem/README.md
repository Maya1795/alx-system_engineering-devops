Postmortem: June 24, 2024 Outage

Issue Summary

o Duration: June 24, 2024, from 14:00 to 16:30 UTC

o Impact: 80% of our users couldn't access our primary web application. Instead of our beautiful homepage, they were greeted with the dreaded 500 Internal Server Error message. It's like inviting friends over and locking the door.

o Root Cause: A misconfigured load balancer that failed to distribute traffic correctly, leading to server overload and service disruption.

Timeline

o 14:00 UTC: Issue detected via monitoring alert indicating a high error rate.

o 14:05 UTC: Engineering team notified of the alert.

o 14:10 UTC: Initial investigation began, focusing on the application server logs.

o 14:30 UTC: Assumed root cause was a database connectivity issue; database team was involved.

o 15:00 UTC: Further investigation revealed no issues with the database; shifted focus to network infrastructure.

o 15:30 UTC: Discovered misconfiguration in the load balancer settings.

o 15:40 UTC: Escalated to the network engineering team for resolution.

o 16:00 UTC: Load balancer configuration corrected and system reboot initiated.

o 16:30 UTC: Services restored, monitoring confirmed normal operation.

Root Cause and Resolution

Root Cause

The culprit was a sneaky misconfiguration in our load balancer. During a routine update meant to optimize performance, some critical backend servers were accidentally left out. This caused the remaining servers to buckle under the pressure like the last Jenga piece.

Resolution

Our network engineering team fixed the configuration, ensuring all servers were part of the load balancerâ€™s traffic pool. After a system reboot to clear any lingering issues, the services returned to their usual, impeccable selves.

Corrective and Preventative Measures

Improvements/Fixes

o Load Balancer Configuration Review: Implement a rigorous review process for any load balancer configuration changes.

o Enhanced Monitoring: Add detailed monitoring and alerts for load balancer performance metrics.

o Documentation: Improve documentation on load balancer setup and maintenance procedures.

o Training: Conduct regular training sessions for the engineering team on network infrastructure management.


Task List

o Patch Load Balancer: Update and apply any recommended patches to the load balancer.

o Monitoring Setup: Add specific monitoring for load balancer health, including traffic distribution metrics and error rates.

o Documentation Update: Create a comprehensive guide on load balancer configuration changes and maintenance.

o Review Process: Establish a change review board to approve and audit any significant infrastructure changes.

o Training Program: Schedule bi-annual training sessions focused on network infrastructure and load balancer management.
